# HOMEWORK 4: MANIPULATING TWITTER DATA WITH FUNCTIONS
> * Due date: Midnight on Wednesday, 10/4 (1 week)
> * Part I: Using Github like the cool kids we are
> * Part II: Homework
> * To submit: See Part II, Step 4

## Preamble
This homework will require some googling. As a software engineer, a lot of what you'll need to do is express what you're TRYING to do, and then read code and documentation in order to achieve it. Remember: StackOverflow and Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) are your friend!

## Part I: Setting Up Your GitHub
While on your master branch, pull the most recent changes from the upstream repository using `git pull --rebase upstream master`
Create a new branch to do Homework 5

## PART II: Reading response
Write your reading response here!

## Part III: JavaScript Homework

### Step 1: Reverse a tweet
> Open the following 2 files in Atom:
>  
>  * hw05/part1.html
>  * hw05/scripts/part1.js

Complete the following 2 tasks:

1. Write a function called "reverseText" that takes a single string as an input. It should return that string with all characters reversed (`e.g., "Hello, world" will return "dlrow ,olleH"`).You can test this in the browser by updating the forEach function to reverse every tweet's text
> HINT: This is a common interview question to screen out javascript devs who don't understand the language's native functions. Google around - you might find a good solution for this problem.

Once you've written your reverse text function, write a comment describing how it works.

2. Now, write a function called "reverseTweet" that takes a single string as an input. If the string contains a hashtag (#), it should return the string. If it doesn't contain a hashtag, it should return the string with all characters reversed. Update the forEach function so that it reverses tweets that don't have hashtags
> HINT: Strings have a useful function called [indexOf]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf)) that you may find useful
> HINT: You already have a reverseText function laying around...

### Step 2: Filtering Data
> Open the following 2 files in Atom:
>  
>  * hw05/part2.html
>  * hw05/scripts/part2.js

Complete the following task:

1. Create a new variable called tweetsWithHashtags
2. Call the "filter" function on the json.statuses array. The filter function returns an array, so you can assign it `tweetsWithHashtags`. Read more about filter here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
3. Write an anonymous function that checks each tweet's text, and filters out tweets that do NOT have hashtags.
4. Update the forEach function so that it runs on the new tweetsWithHashtags array

### Step 3: Submit Your Homework via GitHub + Moodle
This week, you're going to submit your homework to GitHub. To do so:

1. Just as in Step three, open your Terminal and type: `$ git status`. It should tell you which file you've changed.
2. To "commit" all of your changes, type: ` $ git commit -am 'Homework 5 updates'`
3. To "push" your change to up to your github account, type: `$ git push`
4. Finally, verify that your changes are up on GitHub by logging into your GitHub account and taking a look.
5. Submit your homework by paste a link to your branch into the Moodle.
